                    Among the Students of Claro M. Recto Senior High School</b></h3>
                <p class="gray-text"><p> 
                    <b>Chapter 1
                    Introduction</b>
                    <p>Studies have shown that people lacking intellect or mastery tend to overestimate their
                    abilities, leading to flawed self-assessment and false assumptions that they are better than the
                    average person, due in part to their lack of metacognition or self-awareness needed to perceive
                    their own ignorance (Dunning, 2011). Self-monitoring is essential in effectively controlling one’s
                    own behavior and attitudes in learning. In this paper, we will review the empirical and
                    real-world evidence of the Dunning-Kruger Effect and the better-that-average phenomenon, and
                    its applicability in the context of Filipino senior high school students of Claro M. Recto Senior
                    High School.</p>
                   <b><p>Background of the Study</p></b> 
                    <p>Accurate self-assessment can lead to academic improvement (Papanthymou & Darra 2018)
                    and overall better learning outcome. However, people, especially those who are novices in their
                    field, lack the necessary facilities to recognize their ignorance necessary for the accurate
                    estimation of their own abilities. This is due in part to their lack of metacognition or
                    self-awareness needed to perceive their own ignorance (Dunning, 2011).</p>
                    <p>Incidences of the Dunning-Kruger effect in the real world is observed by numerous studies
                    across different fields: a substantial number of individuals believe that their financial situation is
                    better than average (Barrafrem et. al., 2020), people tend to underestimate their bias and racial
                    prejudice, believing themselves to be more tolerant than average (West, 2019), and English
                    language students in higher education who grossly underperformed in demonstrating information
                    literacy has no calibration of their own skills, overestimating their abilities in self-assessment
                    (Mahmood, 2016).</p>
                    <p>This also applies in the field of healthcare and medicine: a study of 639 healthcare workers
                    showed that 74 percent reported self-compliance to hand hygiene protocols, but only 51 percent
                    positively reported their colleagues (Kelcikova et. al, 2019). Moreover, people who lack the
                    knowledge of basic facts and dismissal of misinformation tend to think that they are
                    better-informed than healthcare professionals (Motta et. al., 2018).
                    These incidences of failing to see one’s ignorance in linked to the nature of ignorance itself:
                    according to assertions made by David Dunning, people suffer from the double burden of being
                    incompetent and being ignorant of their own ignorance. “Instead, they often believe they act with
                    adequate if not excellent expertise, when instead they misstep out of misunderstanding and
                    miscalculation that they fail to recognize as such.” (Dunning, 2011) This unknown unknowns
                    make it hard for people to recognize incompetence when they lack the facilities in the subject to
                    begin with.</p>
                    <p>The Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) is demonstrated in people's ability to recognize the
                    perceived accuracy and integrity of the media (Stimmers, 2020), which affects the people's
                    ability to hone information literacy, which, in turn, allows them to be targets of fake news
                    (Jones-Jang et al. 2021).</p>
                    <b><p>Theoretical Framework</p></b>
                   <p> This study will be guided by the empirical studies published by D. Dunning in the journal
                    “Advances in Experimental Social Psychology” (2011) where he asserts two things about
                    ignorance: its prevalence in our daily lives, and its invisibility from those who suffer it. Dunning
                    states: “...any individual’s mental catalogue of their areas of ignorance is likely to be very
                    incomplete… because many of their deficits are camouflaged in one of two ways. First, many
                    instances of ignorance fall into the category of unknown unknowns. Second, many instances of
                    ignorance may be obscured because they are hidden behind misbeliefs that people mistake for
                    valid knowledge in the domain in question.” (Dunning, 2011)</p>
