                </div>

        </section>
        <div class="gold-border">
            <div class="product-type-message">
                <h3 class="text-uppercase gray-text product-type-message-title"><b>A Promenade</b></h3>
                <p class="gray-text"><p> There must be an unwritten rule that public schools should celebrate their Juniors and Seniors' Promenade, if  there be one, in a basketball gym. </p>

                <p>     And indeed a basketball gym it is, with an arch welcoming the newcomers, being the first thing we see once we step inside the venue. Twisted branches of faux oak serves as the base of the said arch, adorned with flowers that permeate an old-lady scent upon entry. Interestingly, it doesn't look even barely otherworldly. Instead, it feels more like home, being bought from the shops along the streets of Tabora.</p>      
            
                <p>     Just like other preceding years a red carpet was unrolled within the arch but it stops short after a few meters. Evidently it has seen better days and better promenades, suffering many tears along the edges and discolorations where it is mostly trodden upon by high-heels and expensive leather shoes, but the school never really considered removing the old carpet from service. Is it sentiment? Is it tradition? Or is it the sheer lack of budget? </p>
            
                <p>     The reader may, we will come inside, where the last draft of cool air ends. Brightly colored crepe papers hang in festoons on the ceiling providing a stark inconsistency in taste to the flowers we just happened to pass. There are a few tables scattered around the gym's floor, with a wide, bare area in the middle that, I suppose, will serve its purpose as the dance floor for six hundred beautifully dressed but awkward kids for the whole night. A high-powered spotlight illuminates the entirety of the setup with either a warm or cool glow, transitioning barely perceptively, fading slowly until one became the other, or depending to the whims of the lights operator. Then again, it doesn't agree with neither the childish design of crepe papers nor the elegance of flowers: no, it makes everything look horribly mismatched.</p> 
            
                <p>     However, we must admire the youth for their juvenile indifference as to what their surroundings look like. Public school kids can see that this scenario isn't entirely new. They are used to subpar facilities, and it has been drilled into their young, impressionable minds that complaining, especially about things that are free, is extremely disrespectful and pointless.</p>
            
                <p>     As a matter of fact, they paid for this function, but it covers only the bare minimum, and it is light years away from what their counterparts in private schools are paying for. No air conditioned ballrooms, no catering, no winding staircases, no chandeliers. No wonder why public schools' promenades held in basketball gyms and parking lots hold a reputation for being cheap, giving memories for a lifetime from cheap venues with expensive clothes and awkward first dances. </p>
            
                <p>     But we must adapt their indifference and give the appearance of the venue no further attention and pay close attention to the guests instead, especially to the three figures standing together near the bleachers. </p>
            
            
                <p> It is now six o' clock, and the dimming sky is illuminated by the afterglow of the recent sunset, creating a nautical twilight in the deep shade of blood red and scarlet. [Maybe it can be attributed to its commonness, with the sun setting almost on a daily basis; or maybe, paintings in the sky are neither as colorful nor captivating enough to hold attention equally with the ball gowns on the ground.] No one notices the beauty of it, ut let us forgive the youthful vanity that preoccupies our guests and remark how clumsily and awkwardly they pour into the venue in a strange mismatch of clothing and the mode of transport they arrived with. </p>
            
                <p>Those who lived a few blocks away arrived on foot, promenading on their ball gowns and suits along the narrow, crowded streets of Tondo and attracting interested looks from bystanders and onlookers. Each of them handles this unsolicited attention quite differently to their own. Some bashfully looks down and hides in their shell, but some owned it, walking with their head high, as if showing the world the consequence of the only day they allow themselves a little elegance and luxury. </p>  
            
                <p>There are some who cruised the streets in pedicabs and tricycles with their billowing gowns and petticoats occupying the entirety of the interior of the vehicle. As for avoiding attention from strangers in the streets, this might have worked in theory as it further reduced the time they are allowed to stare, if it didn't look like a disastrous procession of overgrown Princessitas of Santacruzan.  </p>
            
                <p>And finally, shoes peeped out from cars driven by their dads. Maybe it's carpool, or rented service. It doesn't matter; no one dwells on the fact that you walked or arrived on a limousine. </p> 
            
                <p>We might want to return to the three figures we mentioned earlier. These three young men, standing near the bleachers and away from the forming crowd in the dance floor (with the lack of music) are having an animated conversation of their own.</p>
